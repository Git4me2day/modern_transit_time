I have not tested "update_sys_time.py" yet. I have tested convert_to_local_time.py and it works as far as I can tell. We need real world tresting

The .fits image test files I have used are from the Seestar but I need files from other plate solved images for futher testing. 

Environment:

# clone repo with

$ git clone https://github.com/thgnetworks/modern_transit_time

# Create a venv for the repo

$ cd modern_transit_time
$ python3 -m venv myenv
In Mac and Linux
$ source myenv/bin/activate

Make sure the following packages are installed in pip 

$ pip  list
Package           Version
----------------- -------------------
astropy           6.1.0
astropy-iers-data 0.2024.5.20.0.29.40
numpy             1.26.4
packaging         24.0
pip               24.0
pyerfa            2.0.1.4
PyYAML            6.0.1

A note on the fit file Exif data format
you can see the fields if if you use the following commands

(myenv) $ python
>>> import datetime
>>> import sys
>>> from astropy.io import fits
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> from astropy.coordinates import Angle
>>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
>>> import astropy.units as u
>>> 
>>> hdul = fits.open("test_images/Stacked_136_M 61_10.0s_IRCUT_20240510-220116.fit")
>>> hdul[0].header['*']

If you get the fields your envornment is good to go for the program.
