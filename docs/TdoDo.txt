I may rename is project as or at the least use my domain for GROKLinux.org that I own

Geospatial
Realtime
Observatory
Kit


1. Create a flow chart of the process from telescope setup to havinging an updated time on the NTP server

2. Make a list of all the scripts, hardware and software neccessary to complete the task

3. Make a test setup based on the flowchart

4. Make a test doc to verify my testing

5. Create an MTT (Modern Transit Time) image for RPi including an NTP server


Preliminary Hardware
01. Raspberry Pi 4 with Real-Time Clock
02. Basic Telescope on an Alt mount  (larger apperture for quicker images, maybe a 4" reflector?)
03. Camera that works with RPi and Telescope
04. Cables
05. Power supply
06. Semi perminent mount or pier
07. GPS reciever to test date and time functions
Future Wish list
08. A automated polaris finder for quick and easy field use.
09. Dedicated Observotory to house the telescope

Preliminary Setup
01. Choose sutubale location for pier
02. Install pier
03. Install Mount on Pier 
04. Align mount to Meridian (North and South)
05. Install Telescope and camera on mount
06. Install MTT image on RPi
07. Connect MTT-RPi to camera and power
08. Connect to MTT-RPi via wireless and take test image
09. Run tests based on test doc proceedure
