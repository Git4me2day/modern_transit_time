# modern_transit_time
This is a collection of scripts to calculate ones local time based on plate solved astronomical images for a telescope fixed on local maridian

Suggestion from John Rogers on the cloudy night forum "Modern Transit Instrument)

Set up a telescope on your prime meridian near the celestial equator.  You could then take an image, and plate-solve it to determine the exact right ascension.  Your local sidereal time could then be easily calculated.  In fact, you could do this without apriori knowledge of the time and obtain the exact value after a few iterations.  It would not require you to wait for a known star to appear in your field of view, since you have millions of random stars to choose from.

You could set it up to continuously update all night long and gain the advantage of a mean value.

I will update this file as necessary
